## 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built using traditional yet powerful Microsoft technologies, with a focus on layered separation of concerns:

- *.NET Framework* – for building robust Windows desktop applications.
- *Windows Forms* – for creating the user interface.
- *ADO.NET* – for direct data access and interaction with SQL Server.
- *SQL Server* – as the relational database backend.
- *N-Tier Architecture* – separating the project into:
  - *Presentation Layer* (UI)
  - *Business Logic Layer (BLL)*
  - *Data Access Layer (DAL)*

> ✅ This architecture improves maintainability, testability, and scalability of the application.
